/**
 * Global Styles: body
 * -------------------
 * Author: Marissa Abao
 *
 * Description:
 * Defines the base styling for the entire application.
 * Sets a clean sans‑serif font and a comfortable padding
 * around the page to ensure readable and uncluttered layout.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Provide consistent typography across the app.
 * - Create spacing that prevents elements from touching the edges.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Additional global styles (colors, resets, themes)
 *   will be added later as the UI system evolves.
